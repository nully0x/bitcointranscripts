Bitcoin To Billions Of Transactions Per Day

We're doing a presentation on the lightning network and micropayments. Right now bitcoin faces some interesting problems, like transactions aren't instant, and micropayments don't work. The transaction fees are 1/10th of a cent or higher depending on the exchange rate. And, "bitcoin doesn't scale" especially if you have a lot of micropayments. One megabyte blocks? Well, let's increase them. What happens? Well, you go from 7 transactons per second with 1 megabyte with about 220 million transactions per year. With a 7 billion population on the planet, that's less than one transaction per year or substantially less.

What does bitcoin look like with more than 1 billion transactions per day? Well that's 1.8 GB (1655 MB) and about 87 terabytes/year. You can store enough transactions from a year for a place maybe the size of San Francisco or another metro area. Well you might say okay, let's up it even more. Then what happens? Well you get some centralization, right.
