BC: Adam Back is here for the time on this show. Some of you will be familiar that Adam Back is the inventor of proof-of-work or hashcash as it was then. He was one of the few people cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. More recently he has been involved in sidechains and Blockstream where he is a founder. He has been vocal in the bitcoin block size debate and how it should be done or how it should be done. We're excited to have him on. We've had perhaps too much of the other side, so we're having him on to talk about the block size scaling issues.
