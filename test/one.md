Why bitcoin needs a measured approach to scaling

Name: Adam Back (adam3us)
Epicenter (EC)

Sebastien Couture (SC)
Brian Fabian Crain (BC)

BC: Adam Back is here for the second time on this show. Some of you will be familiar that Adam Back is the inventor of proof-of-work or hashcash as it was then. He was one of the few people cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. More recently he has been involved in sidechains and Blockstream where he is a founder. He has been vocal in the bitcoin block size debate and how it should be done or how it should be done. We're excited to have him on. We've had perhaps too much of the other side, so we're having him on to talk about the block size scaling issues.

AB: It's good to be on.

BC: You mentioned that it's important to talk about what bitcoin actually is. And of course, I don't know if we've had that question asked in that podcast. We always sort of presumed that people knew about what bitcoin is. Why don't you share what you see in bitcoin and hwat you would like to see?
