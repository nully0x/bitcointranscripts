Pierre: So I listened to Laolu on Stephan Livera’s podcast and I would encourage any of our listeners to go listen to that first so that they can hear all about some of the latest developments in lightning. I remember you covered AMP and various other topics including Neutrino. I’ll try not to bring those topics up although we can maybe go deeper on them. We’ll try to cover some new ground. What I feel like was not covered in the Stephan Livera interview was Laolu’s background, his software engineering career and what led him to his end… obviously the same for you Conner. Your involvement in lightning. Let’s start off with that. Where did you guys go to college
