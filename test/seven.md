# Intro (Michael Ep)

Hello and welcome to tonight’s Satoshi’s 21 seminar session hosted by the Bitcoin Munich meetup. We are always looking for good presenters or other contributors for this format by the way. So don’t hesitate to approach us. Our audience is usually a good mix of experienced Bitcoiners as well as more general audience with a good background in tech, finance and other fields as well as newcomers. If you are new today, welcome, price is rising of course. That draws a lot of new interest. Tonight will be a bit technical but feel free to ask any questions you might have. There are no stupid questions. We have also connected a VR room to make this event a little bit more real life like. We already tried this out. If you are in VR we can hear you and we can communicate and you can contribute to the discussion later. Today we will cover some basics on the technical side of Bitcoin mining and then go into some specific details of the new Stratum version 2 protocol.
