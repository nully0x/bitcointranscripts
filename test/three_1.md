Alright. Strong crowd here, I can see. That's very nice.

# Introduction

will talk about provably bug-free BIPs and implementations. I don't have such a BIP nor such an implementation but if you lower your time-preference enough this could eventually be true at some point. This presentation is only 15 minutes so raise your hand if you have questions.

Just to set the stage. Specifications should be free of bugs, we want them easy to implement and hard to misinterpret. This makes writing specifications a slow and exhausting and thankless process.
