# Introduction

Our next speaker is Ben Fisch, part of the Stanford Applied Crypto team and he has done a lot of work that is relevant to the blockchain space. Proofs of replication, proofs of space, he is also one of the coauthors of a paper that defined the notion of verifiable delay functions. He has also worked on accumulators, batching techniques, vector commitments, and one of his latest works is exciting which is DARKs which he is going to talk about today.

Today I will be talking about our latest work on transparent SNARKs. This is work we put out around in the fall and we have made some improvements that I will mention throughout the talk but the bulk of the talk will focus on what we published.
